                            Founded in the early ‘50s, Burger King has long been an American institution. Many people consider the Golden Age of Burger King to be the 1970s, as it dominated the fast food market and had a strong advertising campaign. Its success was revitalized in the early 2000s thanks to The King character, who has since become a recognizable piece of American pop culture. Of course, the food itself is also killer, with the world-renowned Whopper leading the pack. In 2002, it claimed to have sold 1.7 billion Whoppers in a single year. All hail the king.

                        Headquartered in San Diego and primarily serving the west coast, Jack in the Box is famous for its delicious tacos, which are frozen and then deep fried at the restaurants. The company sells over 550 million tacos a year, making it their most popular product by far. The chain also offers some unique sides such as egg rolls. Jack in the Box has over 2,000 locations throughout the United States, and in 2020 it posted an impressive revenue of $1 billion. Even though this chain is mostly relegated to the west coast and Texas, it’s clearly very popular.

                        For those looking to capture the ‘50s experience, Sonic is your place. The main attraction of Sonic are the carhops that deliver food to your vehicle. This tradition was quite popular throughout the ‘40s and ‘50s, but rapidly declined once drive-thrus became standardized. This unique service has helped Sonic become a fast food icon. It has over 3,500 locations throughout the United States and brought in over $4.6 billion in revenue in 2020. This may have been aided by the Covid-19 pandemic, as its carhop system weathered restaurant closures and social distancing measures. Put simply, there’s no other fast food chain quite like Sonic.

                        This fast food chain that is seemingly immune to all criticism. Regardless of all the jokes, memes, and regrets after the fact, Taco Bell just keeps chugging along. Taco Bell has long dominated the Mexican fast food industry, offering tacos, burritos, and various novelty items. The restaurant is relatively inexpensive compared to its competitors, and customers get a lot of food for their dollars. Furthermore, their novelty items like the Doritos Locos Tacos and breakfast waffle tacos were unique inventions that quickly went viral. Taco Bell has mastered both fast food and social media marketing, ensuring incredible success.

                        The chicken tenders are amazing, but Raising Cane’s wouldn’t be the same without their buttery, garlic texas toast. The texas toast is so fluffy and freshly seasoned that it tastes like it just came out of your grandma’s oven. The toast at Cane’s sets them apart from Chick Fil A and other competitors, making it feel more like a home cooked meal. If you get Cane’s to go, the strong aroma of greasy fried chicken fingers will hang in your car for a few days following – making your cravings undeniable after getting in your car after a long day at school.

                        This is the fast food chain to end all fast food chains, and it is instantly recognized the world over. Virtually everything about McDonald’s is popular, from its mascot to its golden arches to its menu, which includes heavy hitters like the Quarter Pounder, Chicken McNuggets, and of course, the Big Mac. It has also found a way to cater to every demographic. Its Playplace and Happy Meals help convert children, and its cheap breakfasts are a favorite of adults. To absolutely no one’s surprise, McDonald’s is by far the most prolific fast food chain in the world, with almost 40,000 restaurants dotting the globe. Try as other chains might, there’s simply no toppling the arches.

                        Serving as KFC’s main competitor, Popeyes is a fried chicken chain based out of Louisiana. The restaurant serves all the basics, including fried chicken and chicken sandwiches. But what makes this chain unique is its southern flair. Aside from its chicken, the chain serves unique items such as Cajun fries, biscuits, and red beans and rice. In 2019, Popeyes began selling its iconic chicken sandwich, which launched what’s hilariously known as the Chicken Sandwich Wars. Essentially, the sandwich was such a monumental success that other fast food chains made their own version to capitalize on the trend. Popeyes’ impact on the industry can’t be overstated.

                        It’s the largest chicken sandwich chain in the United States and the third-largest fast food company. In the early 2010s, Chick-fil-A weathered considerable controversy over its opposition towards same-sex marriage. The restaurant chain remains popular however, and in 2016 Chick-fil-A was the highest-selling fast food chain in the US, grossing nearly $5 million per restaurant while only being open six days a week. By the end of 2019, Chick-fil-A had 2,470 locations in the US and made a very impressive $11 billion in revenue. Its sandwich continues to rank highly in the Chicken Sandwich Wars.

                        The consistency of product across the chain is remarkable not because it is so unique—pretty much all fast food joints have managed to rationalize the means of production to the point of delivering consistently similar burgers—but because only fresh ingredients are used and the food is created in each location, not in some factory ahead of time. While a typical fast food drone need only dunk a bag of frozen fries in to a fryer with a predetermined cooking cycle, an In-N-Out employee takes actual potatoes, puts them in to a press to make the fries fresh before cooking them. They can even honor special requests such as "light" or "well done"; try that at your average fast food joint.

                        As the third-largest hamburger chain in the world, Wendy’s needs no introduction. The restaurant boasts over 6,700 locations across the globe, with almost 6,000 of those being in the United States alone. Despite opening in 1969, which isn’t that long ago compared to some of the other heavy-hitters, Wendy’s is in all 50 US states. The chain has become an icon of American culture, with many of its items becoming mainstays across the country. They include the signature burgers with fresh, square patties; the heart attack-inducing Baconator; and of course, the refreshing Frosty. You can’t really go wrong at Wendy’s.
