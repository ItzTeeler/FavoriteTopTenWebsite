- Favorite Top 10 Website
- (Description) - Webisite should consist of a home page, top 10 Fast food and top 10 Restaurants. Should have a functional navbar that will redirect the user to option of choice and at the end of each top 10 should be a go back to top button. Home page (landing page) should present the user of 2 options--  Fast food or Restaurants. Website should be responsive to desktop and tablet.
- (Peer Review) - Aidan Younathan: Alright this was a GIANT L with Wendy' coming in at first. They got no flavor and mediocre frostys I could get at burger king or ampm. Anyways, once again going with the solid Tomatoe theme, solid choice. I like what you did with the main page where it shows you both pages and I think that's a good choice. The lists have good content and when sizing down it continues to work well. Good job!
