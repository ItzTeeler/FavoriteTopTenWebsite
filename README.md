- (Peer Review) - Aidan Younathan: Alright this was a GIANT L with Wendy' coming in at first. They got no flavor and mediocre frostys I could get at burger king or ampm. Anyways, once again going with the solid Tomatoe theme, solid choice. I like what you did with the main page where it shows you both pages and I think that's a good choice. The lists have good content and when sizing down it continues to work well. Good job!
